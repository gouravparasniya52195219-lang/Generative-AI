# Generative-AI python

Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that employs generative models to produce new content like text, images, videos, audio, or code from learned patterns in training data, often via natural language prompts

These systems, powered by deep learning and neural networks, analyze vast datasets to generate novel outputs resembling human creations, distinguishing them from predictive AI.
